# Todo List

This is a simple Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The functionalities include adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, clearing completed tasks, viewing the number of uncompleted tasks, and saving tasks between sessions.

## Features

1. **Adding Tasks:** You can add new tasks by typing them into the input field and pressing the `Enter` key. If the input field is empty, the application will alert you to write something.

2. **Marking Tasks as Complete:** Tasks can be marked as complete by checking the checkbox next to each task. Checked tasks are struck through to visually represent their completion status.

3. **Clearing Completed Tasks:** The application provides a button to clear all completed tasks from the list.

4. **Task Counter:** The application maintains a counter that displays the number of uncompleted tasks left.

5. **Saving Tasks Between Sessions:** The application saves your tasks in your browser's local storage. This means you can close the tab or the browser, and your tasks will still be there when you come back. However, the tasks are not shared between different browsers or devices, and they will be lost if you clear your browser's local storage.
